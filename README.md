# Freshdesk Plug-in for Franz

A simple plug-in for Freshdesk.

### Usage

This is currently not in Franz' main channel so to install the plug-in you have
to copy **the contents of this folder** (not the folder itself!) to

* Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Franz/recipes/dev/freshdesk`
* Windows: `%appdata%/Franz/recipes/dev/freshdesk`
* Linux: `~/.config/Franz/recipes/dev/freshdesk`

and restart Franz.

### How to create your own Franz recipes:
